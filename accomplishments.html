                    Odyssey of the Mind World Champion 2015: I participated in Odyssey of the Mind in 5th grade with my classmates. We worked
                    together to create a skit, demonstrating creative ideas based on the rules given with the prompt. We prepared for many
                    long hours to perform well in both the spontaneous round and the long-term performance. Our hard work paid off, and we
                    won the district, regional, and state levels of the competition. We were given the opportuntiy to compete in World Finals
                    in Ames, Iowa. In the last round of the competition, we placed 6th in the world.
