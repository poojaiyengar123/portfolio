            Hi there! I'm Pooja, a current junior attending South Brunswick High School, graduating class of 2023.
        </p>
        <p id = "aboutPara">
            I am an avid programmer and have experience coding in Java, Python, Pygame, C, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and Scratch.
            I'm an executive officer of my school's computer science club. As board members of the club, we initially started teaching students how to code in Python and we eventually began teaching how to code games using Pygame.
            The next year, our board of officers split up into groups to teach various types of workshops to interested students. For the past year, I've been leading a workship in C programming.
            Besides being a part of my school's computer science club, I was also a member of Viking Leadership Alliance, a selective club comprised of students looking to help improve the school community and X-STEM, a club through which students can build their own businesses and pitch their ideas in nationwide competitions.
            Additionally, I'm a member of Viking Volunteers, a volunteering club in school, where I am a subcommittee representative of a subcommittee called Care for the Community. As the representative for this subcommittee, I plan various events and fundraisers throughout the year to help specific groups in our community. 
        </p>
        <p id = "aboutPara">
            I love volunteering and I use my knowledge in coding to help other people.
            I am a Project Lead in a student-run 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called Code 4 Tomorrow, aiming to make coding accessible for all.
            I have led a team of people to develop curriculum in Scratch for our teachers to utilize and our students to learn from.
            Currently, I am the Project Lead for C, where I head the development of curriculum in C for our teachers and students to use. 
            I was recently awarded with the Presidential Service Volunteering Gold Award for volunteering 100 hours in the year of 2020.
            I'm always looking for more volunteering opportunities and STEM internships so I can continue to make a difference in my community!
