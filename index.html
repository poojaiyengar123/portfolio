            Hi there! I'm Pooja, a current sophomore attending South Brunswick High School, graduating class of 2023.
        </p>
        <p id = "aboutPara">
            I am an avid programmer and have experience coding in Java, Python, Pygame, C, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Scratch.
            I'm an executive officer of my school's computer science club. As board members of the club, we initially started teaching students how to code in Python and we eventually began teaching how to code games using Pygame.
            Besides being a part of my school's computer science club, I'm also an active member in Viking Leadership Alliance, a selective club comprised of students looking to help improve the school community.
            Additionally, I'm a member of Viking Volunteers, a volunteering club in school, and X-STEM, a club through which students can build their own businesses and pitch their ideas in nationwide competitions.
        </p>
        <p id = "aboutPara">
            I also love volunteering and I use my knowledge in coding to help other people.
            I am a Project Lead in a student-run 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called Code 4 Tomorrow, aiming to make coding accessible for all.
            I lead a team of people to develop curriculum in Scratch for our teachers to utilize and our students to learn from.
            I was recently awarded with the Presidential Service Volunteering Gold Award for volunteering 100 hours in the year of 2020.
            I'm always looking for more volunteering opportunities and STEM internships so I can continue to make a difference in my community!
